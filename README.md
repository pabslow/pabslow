## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pablo, and I work on Portabloc.

I focus on improving the internet experience through my projects. I'm always learning, and I follow these principles in my work:

1. Semantic everything.
2. Bloated code? Wait, I'll fix it with CSS.
3. PHP is not dead.
4. Keep It Stupidly Simple.
5. Software will be free or it will not be.
6. Make internet small again.
